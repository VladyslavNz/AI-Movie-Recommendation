# Movie Recommendation System Using Neural Networks

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on artificial neural networks. The system recommends movies to users by analyzing their preferences and the content of the movies.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and movie content.
- Deep neural network model that uses user and movie embeddings along with bias terms.
- Explanation for each recommendation, showing why certain movies were recommended based on user preferences.

## Requirements

- Python version **3.11** (recommended).
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip`):

## DATASET
- This dataset (MovieLens 20M) was used in the project, utilizing data from movies.csv and ratings.csv.
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn requests
